# Commercial tools for digitising music scores

## Commercial OMR Software

Several commercial Optical Music Recognition (OMR) software options exist, although they weren't mentioned in the search results:

- **PhotoScore**: Developed by Neuratron, this software can scan and recognize printed and handwritten music.

- **SmartScore**: Created by Musitek, SmartScore is another popular commercial OMR solution.

- **SharpEye**: A Windows-based OMR software that can convert scanned music to various digital formats.

## Professional Services

There are companies that offer professional digitization services for sheet music, though none were specifically mentioned in the search results. These services typically involve:

- High-quality scanning of physical scores
- Manual or semi-automated conversion to digital formats
- Proofreading and error correction

## Integrated Solutions

Some music notation software companies offer integrated solutions:

- **Sibelius**: While primarily a notation software, it has a PhotoScore Lite plugin for basic OMR functionality[3].

- **Finale**: Similar to Sibelius, it offers some OMR capabilities through additional software.

## Cloud-Based Services

While not mentioned in the search results, there's a growing trend of cloud-based services in various industries. It's possible that some companies offer OMR as a cloud service, allowing users to upload scanned images and receive digitized scores.

## Challenges and Limitations

It's worth noting that even commercial OMR solutions face challenges:

- Accuracy can vary depending on the quality and complexity of the original score[3].
- Manual correction is often still necessary, especially for complex or handwritten scores.

While commercial tools exist, the field of OMR is still evolving. The lack of recent information in the search results suggests that there may not have been significant breakthroughs in commercial OMR offerings recently. However, with advancements in AI and machine learning, it's possible that new and improved commercial solutions may emerge in the near future.
